    <p class="p1">
        Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is a story about Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands
        into a fantasy
        world that is full of weird, wonderful people and animals. It is classic children's book that is also popular
        with adults. Personally,
        at 16, I found the book strange and uninteresting.
        However if I was 8-14 I would have loved the fantastic fantasy world Carroll creates. I never expected the
        events that happened
        because they were bizarre and unpredictable. I loved the Cheshire cat's wit and
        intelligence. I also love the hatter because his eccentric personality reminded me of the eccentric people I
        know. My favourite
        part was when Alice met the caterpillar, this was because of his ambiguous conversation with Alice.
        However, I thought the events were sometimes random and didn't always connect. I also disliked the number of
        characters, this
        is because sometimes I found it uninteresting and sometimes it meant that I didn't have the development of
        scenes I wanted.
        I believe that it is a clever book that I world have preferred when I was younger because now I have a different
        taste in books.
        Carroll has depicted a unique world that I hadn't seen before. This why I believe it is a book that I would
        recommend.
